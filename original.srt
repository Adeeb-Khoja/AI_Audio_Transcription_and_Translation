0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:03,899
In a single minute, your body produces 120 to 180 million red blood cells.

2
0:00:03,899 --> 0:00:08,060
People ask Google 2.4 million questions, and 25 million Coca-Cola products are consumed.

3
0:00:08,060 --> 0:00:11,040
Many of those bottles will end up in the landfill, where the World Bank estimates to be produced

4
0:00:11,040 --> 0:00:12,339
5 million pounds of garbage.

5
0:00:12,339 --> 0:00:16,260
108 human lives will be lost in this minute, and an adult male will lose 96 million cells.

6
0:00:16,260 --> 0:00:18,699
Fortunately, 96 million cells divide replacing those laws.

7
0:00:18,699 --> 0:00:23,199
Speaking of divisions, in the USA, 1.5 people get divorced while worldwide, 116 people

8
0:00:23,199 --> 0:00:24,199
will get married.

9
0:00:24,199 --> 0:00:27,500
83,300 people have sex, but only 258 babies will be born.

10
0:00:27,500 --> 0:00:30,660
And a fetus is developing neurons at a rate of 250,000 per minute.

11
0:00:30,660 --> 0:00:34,219
So it's no wonder that a computer simulation takes 60 quagged, really, and bites to simulate

12
0:00:34,219 --> 0:00:35,219
a minute.

13
0:00:35,219 --> 0:00:38,399
An average of 1.38 micrometers of rain fall around the world, which is 4.7 billion bath

14
0:00:38,399 --> 0:00:41,620
tubs of water every minute, and with the storms comes approximately 6,000 bolts of

15
0:00:41,620 --> 0:00:43,140
cloud to ground lightning hitting the earth.

16
0:00:43,140 --> 0:00:47,019
A 150 pound person expense 1.1 calories of energy per minute while sleeping, while the

17
0:00:47,019 --> 0:00:49,820
sun provides its with 83.33 terawatts of energy.

18
0:00:49,820 --> 0:00:53,620
The earth will complete 1,800 kilometers of its 940 million around the sun, moving 1,034

19
0:00:53,620 --> 0:00:54,620
times faster than a cheetah.

20
0:00:54,619 --> 0:00:57,939
70,000 hours of Netflix are watched, 300 hours are uploaded to YouTube, and you can watch
